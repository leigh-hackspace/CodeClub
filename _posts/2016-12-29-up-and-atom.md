Getting started with Python
================
Without going into too much detail, Python is quite a good language for people wanting to learn how to program
it's fairly similar to english in the way that you can "see" what things do for example ```len("Hello World!")```
will return the *length* of a string it's given as a parameter - but I digress...

Python can be downloaded from the [Python website][1], we're going to be using [Atom][2] as our text editor but you can use anything you're comfortable with we're also going to be using Python 3 not 2 ([an argument we won't get into as to which is better][6]).

Much like Ruby, Python is _softly typed_ meaning that the variable infer their type from assignment - in plain english when you store a value in a variable in Python, it _becomes_ that type e.g. ``` stringVariable = "string" ``` will make  stringVariable a string but if you were to subsequently do something like ```stringVariable = 0``` it will them become an integer
rather than re-invent the wheel and/or make a hash of introducing you to Python I'll point you at [CodeCademy][3] and suggest that you have a look at their Python course - they've got a ton of courses but for Code Club we're only interested in the Python course.

Once you've completed the Python course on [CodeCademy][3] you'll be ready to go!
there are some [useful guides][4] for how best to format your code and best practices that you should also check out
and if you're feeling _really_ brave why not try out some of the code katas at [CodeWars][5] and don't worry that I only mentioned where to download python and atom - that's for next week ;-)
