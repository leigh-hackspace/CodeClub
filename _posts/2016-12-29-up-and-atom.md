Up And Atom!
================
So Now you've cloned and forked the code club repo and [Downloaded Atom][1] you should see something like the below image:
![Github Desktop Home screen]({{ site.url }}/codeclub/images/git_images/01_GitHub_Home.png)

notice how in the Github desktop client there's an _atom button_ (1)

![Open Repo In Atom]({{ site.url }}/codeclub/images/up_and_atom/01_opening_in_atom_from_repo.png)

click it!

you should be greeted with a screen similar to this(dont worry that it's dark any yours is light - you can change that):
![Open Repo In Atom]({{ site.url }}/codeclub/images/up_and_atom/02_atom_main_screen.png)

There's quite a bit to cover in this so we'll just go over the basics - the more observant might notice that the screen shots in atom are of _this_ blog post ... [how meta!][2] but anyway!!

1. This is your project directory as you can see the top shows the repository name, and then nested inside is a _tree_ folder structure, one of the nice things about Atom is that it integrates with Git and by extension Github so you can see changes made since the last commit in the directory (yellow for modification, green for addition) - in the latest version - different file types even have little icons signifying what they are - markdown files (like this one) have a little markdown symbol; Ruby files have little rubies and so on

2. Across the top of the main _window_ in atom is the working files, in the screen shot above I've only the one file but you can have many - the blue dot denotes that I have unsaved changes in the file

3. Denotes the language used in the file - handy for knowing what type of _syntax highlighting_ you can see in the main file

4. This shows what branch you're currently on - in this case the gh-pages branch which contains the files for the blog - again very meta!

5. This indicates that the file has been modified and shows how many lines have been added (+) and removed (-) since the last commit

6. This shows you a _zoomed out_ view of the file you're currently editing (think of it like high speed scrubbing in a music track or video file)

7. This toolbar is for a particular extension called _Platformio_ which is used for arduino development - you wont have this by default but it's an example of an extension and something to maybe consider looking into once you're a bit better with atom

8. This is a guide for syntax style - it can be ignored for our purposes but if you want to keep your code looking _tidier_ feel free to use it
