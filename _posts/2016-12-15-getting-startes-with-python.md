Getting started with Python
================
without going into too much detail Python is quite a good language for people wanting to learn how to program
it's fairly similar to english in the way that you can "see" what things do for example ```len("Hello World!")```
will return the *length* of a string it's given as a parameter - but I digress...

To download python visit [Python][1] we're going to be using [Atom][2] as our text editor but you can use anything you're comfortable with
