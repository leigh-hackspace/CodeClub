Dealing with time
================
Consider the following example:

```python
def convert_mins_to_hours(mins):
    full_hours = mins/100
    return full_hours

total_hours = int(input("please enter an amount of minutes: "))
print "that is {0} hours".format(total_hours)
```
debug the code and make alterations so that it correctly outputs hours and minutes when give a [whole] number of minutes

Bonus:
-----
extend the script to also out put days if the amount of hours exceed 24
