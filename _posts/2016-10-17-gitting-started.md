'Git'ting Started
================
At Leigh Hackspace we're currently using a few things to keep track of things

[MeetUp][1]<br />
[GitHub][2]<br />
[GitHub Desktop][3]<br />
[Slack][4]<br />

please make an account on each of them (MeetUp,GitHub and Slack)
and send the email address(es)[preferably all one email address] to CodeClub[at]leighhack.org with your name so we know who you are...

but back to GitHub ... or more specifically Git <br />

 Git

and the [GitHub desktop client][3]
