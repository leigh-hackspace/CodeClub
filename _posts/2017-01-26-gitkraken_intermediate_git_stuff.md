Into to Git Kraken
================
This week we'll be exploring (briefly) [Git Kraken][1] - which I think is a nice alternative for the [GitHub desktop client][2] - it even works *with* GitHub too!
but one of my favourite things about it - it's cross platform :wink: (that means it works with Windows :computer:, MacOS :apple: and even Linux :penguin:)
